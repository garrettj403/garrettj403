Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a [Submillimeter Array (SMA)](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/) Fellow at the [Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/). My research is focused on ultra-sensitive submillimeter-wave receivers for radio astronomy.

My software projects:

- Related to radio astronomy:
    - [QMix](https://github.com/garrettj403/QMix): simulate the behavior of SIS tunnel junctions
    - [GaussOpt](https://github.com/garrettj403/GaussOpt): Gaussian beam analysis for quasi-optical systems
- Related to RF engineering:
    - [CZT](https://github.com/garrettj403/CZT): calculate the Chirp Z-Transform, a flexible version of the Fast Fourier Transform
    - [GradientModel](https://github.com/garrettj403/GradientModel): calculate the effective conductivity of a rough metallic surface using the Gradient Model
    - [Mattis-Bardeen](https://github.com/garrettj403/Mattis-Bardeen): calculate the surface impedance of a superconductor using Mattis-Bardeen theory
    - [Waveguide](https://github.com/garrettj403/Waveguide): calculate the various properties of rectangular waveguides, e.g., phase constant, conductor loss, etc.
    - [RF-tools](https://github.com/garrettj403/RF-tools): various tools for RF engineering, including useful command line tools
- Other projects:
    - [SciencePlots](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots): format your Python/Matplotlib plots for scientific papers, theses and presentations
