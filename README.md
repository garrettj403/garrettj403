Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some of my software projects:

- Related to RF engineering:
    - [DispersionTransform](https://github.com/garrettj403/DispersionTransform): map dispersive waveguide data from the frequency- to distance-domain
    - [CZT](https://github.com/garrettj403/CZT): calculate the Chirp Z-Transform, a flexible implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform
    - [GradientModel](https://github.com/garrettj403/GradientModel): calculate the effective conductivity of a rough metallic surface using the Gradient Model
    - [Mattis-Bardeen](https://github.com/garrettj403/Mattis-Bardeen): calculate the surface impedance of a superconductor using Mattis-Bardeen theory
    - [Waveguide](https://github.com/garrettj403/Waveguide): calculate the various properties of rectangular waveguides, e.g., phase constant, conductor loss, etc.
    - [RF-tools](https://github.com/garrettj403/RF-tools): various tools for RF engineering, including useful command line tools
- Related to radio astronomy:
    - [QMix](https://github.com/garrettj403/QMix): simulate quantum tunnneling in SIS junctions
- Other projects:
    - [SciencePlots](https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots): format your Python/Matplotlib plots for scientific papers, theses and presentations
